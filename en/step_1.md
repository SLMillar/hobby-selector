The **micro:bit** is a small computer that you can use to interact with the world around you.

This project will help you **discover** what the **micro:bit** can do before you go on to explore it in more detail. 

### What you will make

Do you ever find yourself wondering what to do with your free time? You can use the micro:bit to help you make those decisions. 

In this project you are going to make a **random hobby selector**. 

You will: 
+ Light up the micro:bit to display images
+ Use random numbers to make choices
+ Use <code style="background-color: #00A4A6">if</code> blocks to control which images are displayed
+ Use the logo or a button to clear the display

### Opening MakeCode

To get started creating your micro:bit project, you will need to open the MakeCode editor.

--- task ---

Open the MakeCode editor at [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org)

--- collapse ---

---
title: Offline version of the editor
---

There is also a [downloadable version of the MakeCode editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/offline-app).

--- /collapse ---

--- /task ---

Once the editor is open, you will need to create a New Project and give your project a name. 

--- task ---

Click on the **New Project** button.

![The new project button inside of MakeCode.](images/new-project-button.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Give your new project the name `hobby-selector` and click **Create**.

![The name 'hobby-selector' written in the New Project dialogue box.](images/new-project.png)

**Tip:** Give your project a helpful name that relates to the activity you‚Äôre creating. This will make it easier to find if you create other projects on MakeCode.

--- /task ---

### The MakeCode Editor

Created by the micro:bit Foundation, the **MakeCode editor** has everything you need to get started coding on micro:bit. 

![The MakeCode Editor window](images/makecode-tour.png)

On the left side there is a **simulator**, this contains a virtual micro:bit that you can use to test your code! 

It has all the features and buttons found on a V2 micro:bit, including:
+ LED display
+ Speaker
+ Microphone
+ Input buttons
    + A
    + B
    + Logo

In the centre there is the **blocks panel** which is colour-coded and allows you to access various code blocks.

On the right side is the **code editor panel** to drag and drop blocks into when creating your program.

The MakeCode editor panel already contains two blocks: `on start` and `forever`.

### Show Icon

You are going to use the `forever` block to see how the LEDs on the simulator work.

--- task ---

Click on the <code style="background-color: #1E90FF">Basic</code> block menu in the Blocks panel. This will expand to show you the blocks available.

![The Basic block menu with the 'show icon' block highlighted](images/basic-blocks.png)

Drag the `show icon` block and place it **inside** the `forever` block. 

This should fit in place like a puzzle.

<div style="position:relative;height:calc(300px + 5em);width:100%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:relative;top:0;left:0;width:75%;height:75%;" src="https://makecode.microbit.org/---codeembed#pub:_iVKhocCVxR3f" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Click the down arrow on the show icon block and choose any icon of your choice.

![The show icon menu expanded to display all available icons](images/show-icons.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Click the play button on the simulator, the LED display should light up, showing your chosen icon.

In this example we have chosen the `X` icon.

![The microbit simulator displaying an 'X' icon on its LEDs with the code blocks showing on the right](images/led-display.png)

Well done for getting the micro:bit to do something!

--- /task ---

### Choose your hobbies. 

--- task ---

Choose 3 hobbies/activities you like to do in your spare time. 

If you can't think of some, here are some ideas to get you started:
+ üéÆ Gaming
+ üìö Reading
+ üßÅ Baking
+ üì∫ Watching TV
+ üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Going for a walk
+ üèê Playing a sport 
+ üé® Drawing

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Change your icon to one that represents your first hobby. 

We chose a Pac-Man ghost to represent gaming! üëª

--- /task ---

### Creating a variable

You are going to use icons to represent three different hobbies.

Each hobby will be linked to a unique number.

You will need to create a variable so you can change which hobby is displayed.

--- task ---

Open the <code style="background-color: #DC143C">Variables</code> menu, and click **Make a variable**.

![The Variables block menu, open with the 'Make a variable' button highlighted](images/variable-menu.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Name the new variable `activity`, then click the `Ok` button.

![The 'New variable name' window, with the name 'activity' written in the box](images/variable-name.png)

--- /task ---

You will now see that there are new blocks you can use to set, change or use the value stored in the `activity` variable. 

![The Variables block menu - with new blocks to set the value of the activity variable, to change the value of the activity variable and to use the value of the activity variable in your code.](images/variable-blocks.png)

--- task ---

Drag the `set [activity] to 0` block inside the `onstart` block.

<div style="position:relative;height:calc(300px + 5em);width:100%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:relative;top:0;left:0;width:75%;height:75%;" src="https://makecode.microbit.org/---codeembed#pub:_YbT2My3k2aXu" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>

--- /task ---

### Which hobby will display?

A different icon should display if <code style="background-color: #DC143C">activity</code> is set to `1`, than if <code style="background-color: #DC143C">activity</code> is set to `2`.

You will use `if... then` blocks to do this. 

--- task ---

Open the <code style="background-color: #00A4A6">Logic</code> menu and choose the `if 'true' then` block. 

![The Logic block menu open with the "if 'true' then" block highlighted](images/if-block.png)

Drag it inside the `forever` loop block **above** your icon block. 

Our example uses a ghost to represent a gaming activity. üëª

<div style="position:relative;height:calc(300px + 5em);width:100%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:relative;top:0;left:0;width:75%;height:75%;" src="https://makecode.microbit.org/---codeembed#pub:_3fXJCKJ7LTAu" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>

--- /task ---

--- task ---

From the <code style="background-color: #00A4A6">Logic</code> menu, drag out a comparison block `0 = 0`.

![The Logic block menu with the condition block '0 = 0' highlighted](images/condition-block.png)

Place it inside the `true` space within the `if..then..else` block.

<div style="position:relative;height:calc(300px + 5em);width:100%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:relative;top:0;left:0;width:75%;height:75%;" src="https://makecode.microbit.org/---codeembed#pub:_CPPLmMhR29Cg" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Head back to the <code style="background-color: #DC143C">Variables</code> menu and grab the small block that says `activity`. 

Drag that block to the **first** `0` in your new comparison block. 

Change the second `0` to a `1`.

<div style="position:relative;height:calc(300px + 5em);width:100%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:relative;top:0;left:0;width:75%;height:75%;" src="https://makecode.microbit.org/---codeembed#pub:_FpsdqdfWx9cu" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Drag your `show icon` block **inside** the `if` block. 

<div style="position:relative;height:calc(300px + 5em);width:100%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:relative;top:0;left:0;width:75%;height:75%;" src="https://makecode.microbit.org/---codeembed#pub:_CJoVdpb0YMFy" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test** your program:

When you make a change to a code block, the simulator will restart.

You should see that nothing appears on the LEDs.

In your `set 'activity' to 0` block, **change** the value from `0` to `1`.

**Re-test**: 

When the simulator restarts after your last change, you should see the icon appear. 

**Make sure to set the value of the activity variable back to `0`.**

--- /task ---

### Adding more hobbies

To add more hobby options to your program, you will need to add more conditions to your `if` block.

--- task ---

Click on the `+` symbol at the bottom of the `if` block. This will create an `else` block. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Click on the `+` symbol below the `else` block. This will create an `else if` block. Do this one more time so you have two `else if` blocks.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Now click on the `-` symbol next to the `else` block to remove the `else` block.

![Using the + symbol, three else if blocks are added to a condition. Finally, the else is removed from the end by clicking the - symbol next to it](images/adding-ifs.gif)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Right click on the whole <code style="background-color: #00a4a6">=</code> block in the first `if` block. 

Click just to the left of the activity variable, or just to the right of the value `0` to make sure you select the whole block.

Click `Duplicate` to make a copy.

![TO-DO add a GIF of duplication]

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Drag the duplicated <code style="background-color: #00a4a6">=</code> block into the first `else if` block. Then change the number `1` to a `2`.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Duplicate the <code style="background-color: #00a4a6">=</code> one more time and drag it into the second `else if` block. Then change the number to a `3`.

<div style="position:relative;height:calc(300px + 5em);width:100%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:relative;top:0;left:0;width:75%;height:75%;" src="https://makecode.microbit.org/---codeembed#pub:_9h6MfxbmaFYu" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>

### Upgrade your project

You can upgrade your project to make it more engaging:

+ Add more hobbies so you can have a wider range to choose from. 

Remember to:
  + Add a different symbol to display for each activity
  + Increase the number of `else if` blocks so you can add more icons
  + Increase the random range to more than three to match the number of added hobbies
